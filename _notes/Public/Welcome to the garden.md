This is a sample atomic note. The file location is `_notes/Public`, and it appears on the note feed. `_notes` is the Obsidian Vault directory. _Check  <a href="../posts/how-to"> how to </a> to know more._ 

While all files inside this folder get rendered and can be linked, only those notes with `notetype: feed` will be listed in the feed. For example, click on this [[Hidden Note]]!

Also, backlinks (pages with a link to this page) are listed down. Check that one to see how markdown styles get rendered in this theme.
