title: Why WordPress Wasn't Enough For Me
description: WordPress is the old way to write blogs. Writing blogs with interconnected notes can make for highly personalized blogs where the user decides what to read.

So originally my blog was hosted on [https://thinkwong.com](https://thinkwong.com). It used WordPress which was good for typical blogging, but I wanted more than that. I wanted to demonstrate the effectiveness of connected notes and the best way to do that was to [[lead by example]]. Hence, I created a website with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) using a [digital garden template](https://github.com/Jekyll-Garden/jekyll-garden.github.io). And because [[interoperability components are efficient]] I write less while providing more value.

Since content is condensed into atomic bits, I can create highly personalized blog posts that allow the reader to dive deeper into whichever idea they find interesting. Knowing that [[time is the most valuable resource]], I can save both your time and mine! I believe [[the future is personalization]] and creating an interconnected system through Fleeting Notes is a way to achieve this.
